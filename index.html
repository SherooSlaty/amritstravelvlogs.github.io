      <td style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse">No school! We stayed at Safie West! It was super fun, I got to sleep in a tent, and I got to sleep on the top bunk! It was a bit cold, so we had to use heated blankets. We went on a safari, and we sat on a jeep, then saw some zebra's on the wild, and some girafs.</td>
      <td style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse">Dailghts Savings happend and I was super tiered at only 8:30 P.M.. I went on to the google meet and did school.</td>
      <td style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse">I had band this moring at 8:45 A.M. I forgot that band was today, and at 8:30 my Mom told me that I had band today. I had to rush, and not eat much breakfast. At band we played A New World Synphony, and I did not like it because playing on a clarinet for that peice, is verry hard becauase there are too many low notes, and my fingers are not that long, and I can not blow that hard for that long. Then we had to go to school (on googe meet) and I dislike using google meet, and the only time I get to use zoom is for Mrs. Woody's Science class, whitch was not today. Anyway, today at 4:00 I am going to meet some friends at the park.</td>
