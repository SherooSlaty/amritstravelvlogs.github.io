      <td style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse">It was a short day today, and because I finished all of my math in class, I did not have to do much work for homework, because I finished it all in class. I am preparing for Christmas Gifts, so I am working on kniting a scarf.(if you are intrested in seeing it this is the link to the picture:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pNGdiUrVsFTE1IUcjAid8vzzUxYoHhmZ/view?usp=sharing)We turned on our fier place, and read books, exsept I finished my book on Friday and Saturday, so I had nothing to read, and I would not get new libuary books till 2 more weeks! So my Mom showed me how to use Libby for getting books, and reading them on my kindle, because I had nothign to read then.</td>
      <td style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse">I am making this thing called Science Clubs, for our school, and what it is, is that there are groups, and they work together on a project about science, and then they will presenent at the science fair. I am incharge of it, and I talked to my Science Teacher (Ms. Woody) about it, and she likes it. We are going to start off with the kids in my class, and then we will move to the whole Fifth Grade, and if that works mabey even forth and fifth grade. I am super exsited about it, and I made a slide show about it, and today I presenented it to my class and I have alot of students that are part of it. I made a google classroom to go with it, and I have alot of students on there. I have to do alot of work creating the clubs, because people will tell me who they want to be in a club with, and then I have to ask those people if they want to be in that club with that person, and I don't have anyone to help me. Today at the end of the day I asked my friend if she will help me with one thing, and she said she will so that makes my life a bit easier!
